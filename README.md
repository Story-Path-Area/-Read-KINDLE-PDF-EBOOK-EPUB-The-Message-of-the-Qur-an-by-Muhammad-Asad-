This is the legitimate translation of and commentary on the Qur'an by Muhammad Asad offered by The Book Foundation, copyright holder of Muhammad Asad's work. As a translation it is one of the most respected. As commentary, it is unsurpassed. Muhammad Asad, born Leopold Weiss, was a towering intellectual figure and lived most of his adult life in Arabia and the Muslim world. He drew upon his extensive knowledge of classical Islamic texts to provide an illuminating commentary founded upon extensive linguistic, cultural, and historical knowledge.
short, Asad's translation relies on reason, elucidation, and concise
explication; it provides extensive footnotes, but not in such quantity
as to overshadow the original text.

For comparison of style, word choice, and commentary (where
applicable), see (below) the translations of Chapter 113 (and chapter 1) by A.J.
Arberry (who must be commended for his nigh literal translation that
flows with poetic grace [it does not use parentheses or brackets]),
Yusuf Ali, and Asad, respectively.

CXIII DAYBREAK
In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate
113:1 Say: 'I take refuge with the Lord of the Daybreak
from the evil of what He has created,
from the evil of darkness when it gathers,
from the evil of the women who blow on knots,
113:5 from the evil of an envier when he envies.'

--------------------
Yusuf Ali 113:
This early Makkan Surah provides the antidote to superstition and fear
by teaching us to seek refuge in Allah from every kind of ill arising
from outer nature and from dark and evil plottings and envy on the
part of others.

C.293 (The running Commentary, in Rhythmic Prose)

It is Allah Who brings forth light from darkness,
life and activity from death, spiritual
Enlightenment from ignorance and superstition
Banish fear, and trust His Providence
No danger, then, from the outer world,
No secret plottings from perverted wills,
No disturbance of your happiness or good
Can affect the fortress of your inmost soul.

1. Say:
I seek refuge with the Lord of the Dawn,
2. From the mischief of created things;
3. From the mischief of Darkness as it overspreads;
4. From the mischief of those who practice Secret Arts;
5. And from the mischief of the envious one as he practices envy.

C6301. In Allah's created world, there are all kinds of forces and
counter-forces, especially those put in motion by beings who have been
endowed with some sort of will.
The forces of good may be compared to light, and those of evil to darkness.
Allah can cleave the depths of darkness and produce light (6:96), and
therefore we should cast off fear and take refuge in divine guidance
and goodness.

C6302. Falaq is the Dawn or Daybreak, the cleaving of darkness and the
manifestation of light.
This may be understood in various senses:
1. literally, when the darkness of the night is at its worst, rays
of light pierce through and produce the dawn;
2. when the darkness of ignorance is at its worst, the light of
Allah pierces through the soul and gives it enlightenment: (24:35);
3. non-existence is darkness, and life and activity may be
typified by light.

C6303. See n. 6301 above.
Our trust in Allah is the refuge from every kind of fear and
superstition, every kind of danger and evil.
Three special kinds of mischief are specified in the next three
verses, against which our best guard is our trust in Allah, the Light
of the heavens and the earth. They are:
1. physical dangers, typified by darkness.
2. physical dangers within us, typified by Secret Arts, and
3. physical dangers from without us, resulting from a perverted
will, which seeks to destroy any good that we enjoy.

C6304. The darkness of the night, physical darkness, is a good type of
physical dangers and difficulties. Many people are afraid of physical
darkness, and all are afraid of physical injuries, accidents, and
calamities.
We should not fear, but having taken reasonable precautions, trust in Allah.

C6305. Those (feminine) who blow on knots', this having been a
favourite form of witchcraft practised by perverted women. Such secret
arts cause psychological terror.
They may be what is called magic, or secre plottings, or the display
of false and seductive charms (3:14), or the spreading of false and
secret rumours or slanders to frighten men or deter them from right
action.
There is fraud in such things, but men are swayed by it. They should
cast off fear and do their duty.

C6306. Malignant envy, translated into action, seeks to destroy the
happiness or the material or spiritual good enjoyed by other people.
The best guard against it is trust in Allah with purity of heart.

Muhammad Asad:
The Hundred-Thirteenth Surah Al-Falaq (The Rising Dawn) Mecca Period
WHEREAS most of the commentators assign this and the next surah to the
early part of the Mecca period, some authorities (e.g., Razi, Ibn
Kathir) consider them to have been revealed at Medina, while yet
others (e.g., Baghawi, Zamakhshari, Baydawi) leave the question open.
On the basis of the scant evidence available to us it appears probable
that both these surahs are of early Meccan origin.

In The Name of God, The Most Gracious, The Dispenser of Grace:
113:1 SAY: "I seek refuge with the Sustainer of the rising dawn,1
(2) "from the evil of aught that He has created,
(3) "and from the evil of the black darkness whenever it descends,2
(4) "and from the evil of all human beings bent on occult endeavours,3
(5) "and from the evil of the envious when he envies."4

1 The term al-falaq ("the light of dawn" or "the rising dawn") is
often used tropically to describe "the emergence of the truth after [a
period of] uncertainty" (Taj al-'Arus): hence, the appellation
"Sustainer of the rising dawn" implies that God is the source of all
cognition of truth, and that one's "seeking refuge" with Him is
synonymous with striving after truth.

2 I.e., the darkness of despair, or of approaching death. In all these
four verses (2-5), the term "evil" (sharr) has not only an objective
but also a subjective connotation - namely, fear of evil.

3 Lit., "of those that blow (an-naffathat) upon knots": an idiomatic
phrase current in pre-Islamic Arabia and, hence, employed in classical
Arabic to designate all supposedly occult endeavours; it was probably
derived from the practice of "witches" and "sorcerers" who used to tie
a string into a number of knots while blowing upon them and murmuring
magic incantations. The feminine gender of naffathat does not, as
Zamakhshari and Razi point out, necessarily indicate "women", but may
well relate to "human beings" (anfus, sing. nafs, a noun that is
grammatically feminine). In his explanation of the above verse,
Zamakhshari categorically rejects all belief in the reality and
effectiveness of such practices, as well as of the concept of "magic"
as such. Similar views have been expressed - albeit in a much more
elaborate manner, on the basis of established psychological findings -
by Muhammad Abduh and Rashid Rida (see Manar I, 398 ff.). The reason
why the believer is enjoined to "seek refuge with God" from such
practices despite their palpable irrationality is - according to
Zamakhshari- to be found in the inherent sinfulness of such endeavours
(see surah 2, note 84), and in the mental danger in which they may
involve their author.

4 I.e., from the effects - moral and social- which another person's
envy may have on one's life, as well as from succumbing oneself to the
evil of envy. In this connection, Zamakhshari quotes a saying of the
Caliph Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz (called "the Second Umar" on account of
his piety and integrity): "I cannot think of any wrongdoer (zalim) who
is more likely to be the wronged one (mazlum) than he who envies
another."

I THE OPENING(Arberry)

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate

1 Praise belongs to God, the Lord of all Being,
the All-merciful, the All-compassionate,
the Master of the Day of Doom.
5 Thee only we serve; to Thee alone we pray for succour.
Guide us in the straight path, the path of those
whom Thou hast blessed, not of those against
whom Thou art wrathful, nor of those who are astray.

--------------------

SURA 1. Fatiha, or the Opening Chapter. (Yusuf Ali)
1. In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.
2. Praise be to Allah, The Cherisher and Sustainer of the Worlds;
3. Most Gracious, Most Merciful;
4. Master of the Day of Judgment.
5. Thee do we worship, and Thine aid we seek.
6. Show us the straight way,
7. The way of those on whom Thou hast bestowed Thy Grace, Those whose
(portion) is not wrath, and who go not astray.

Introduction and Summary

C.42 - The running Commentary, in Rhythmic Prose

First comes that beautiful Surah,

15. Each chapter or portion of the Quran is called a Surah, which
means a Degree Or Step, by which we mount up.
Sometimes whole Surahs were revealed, and sometimes portions, which
were arranged under the Prophet's directions.
Some Surahs are long, and some are short, but a logical thread runs
through them all. Each verse of the Surah is called an Ayah (plural,
Ayat), which means also a sign.

A verse of revelation is a Sign of Allah's beautiful handiwork in the
material creation or His dealings in history are signs to us, if we
would understand. Some Ayat are long, and some are short.

The Ayah is the true unit of the Quran.

The Opening Chapter of Seven Verses,

16. Fatihah: Opening Chapter.

17. These seven verses form a complete unit by themselves, and are
recited in every prayer and on many other occasions.
Cf. 15:87.
Rightly called the Essence of the Book.
It teaches us the perfect Prayer.
For if we can pray aright, it means
That we have some knowledge of Allah
And His attributes, of His relations
To us and His creation, which includes
Ourselves; that we glimpse the source
From which we come, and that final goalWhich is our spiritual destiny
Under Allah's' true Judgement: then
We offer ourselves to Allah and seek His light.

C.43
Prayer is the heart of Religion and Faith
But how shall we pray? What words shall convey
The yearnings of our miserable ignorant hearts
To the Knower of all? It is worthy of Him
Or of our spiritual nature to ask
For vanities, or even for such physical needs
As our daily bread? The Inspired One
Taught us a Prayer that sums up our faith,
Our hope, and our aspiration in things that matter.
We think in devotion of Allah's name and His Nature;
We praise Him for His creation and His Cherishing care;
We call to mind the Realities, seen and unseen;
We offer Him worship and ask His guidance;
And we know the straight from the crooked path
By the light of His grace that illumines the righteous.

18. By universal consent it is rightly placed at the beginning of the
Koran as summing up in marvelously terse and comprehensive words,
man's relation to Allah in contemplation and prayer. In our spiritual
contemplation the first words should be those of praise If the praise
is from our inmost being, it brings us closer to Allah. Then our eyes
see all good, peace, and harmony. Evil, rebellion, and conflict are
purged out. They do not exist for us, for our eyes are lifted up above
them in praise. Then we see Allah's attributes better (verses 2-4).
This leads us to the attitude of worship and acknowledgment (verse 5).
And finally comes prayer for guidance, and a contemplation of what
guidance means (verses 6-7). Allah needs no praise, for He is above
all praise; He needs no petition, for He knows our needs better than
we do ourselves; and His bounties are open without asking, to the
righteous and the sinner alike. The prayer is primarily for our own
spiritual education consolation, and confirmation. That is why the
words in this Sura are given to us in the form in which we should
utter them.

19. The Arabic words "Rahman" and "Rahim " translated "Most Gracious"
and "Most Merciful" are both intensive forms referring to different
aspects of Allah's attribute of Mercy. The Arabic intensive is more
suited to express Allah's attributes than the superlative degree in
English. The latter implies a comparison with other beings, or with
other times or places, while there is no being like unto Allah. Mercy
may imply pity. longsuffering, patience, and forgiveness, all of which
the sinner needs and Allah Most Merciful bestows in abundant measure.
But there is a Mercy that goes before even the need arises, the Grace
which is ever watchful. and flows from Allah Most Gracious to all His
creatures, protecting them, preserving them, guiding them, and leading
them to clear light and higher life. Opinion is divided whether the
Bismillah should be numbered as a separate verse or not. It is
unanimously agreed that it is a part of the Koran in Sura An-Naml.
Therefore it is better to give it an independent number in the first
Sura. For subsequent Suras it is treated as an introduction or
head-line, and therefore not numbered.

20. The Arabic word 'Rabb', usually translated Lord, has also the
meaning of cherishing, sustaining, bringing to maturity. Allah cares
for all the worlds He has created.

21. On realizing in our souls Allah's love and care. His grace and
mercy, and His power and justice (as Ruler of the Day of Judgment),
the immediate result is that we bend in the act of worship, and see
both our shortcomings and His all-sufficient power. The emphatic form
means that not only do we reach the position of worshipping Allah and
asking for His help, but we worship Him alone and ask for His aid
only. For there is none other than He worthy of our devotion and able
to help us. The plural "we" indicates that we associate ourselves with
all who seek Allah, thus strengthening ourselves and strengthening
them in a fellowship of faith.

22. If we translate by the English word "guide", we shall have to say:
Guide us to and in the straight Way". For we may he wandering
aimlessly, and the first step is to find the way; and the second need
is to keep in the Way: our own wisdom may fail in either case. The
straight Way is often the narrow Way, or the steep Way, which many
people shun (Sura 90:11). By the world's perversity the straight Way
is sometimes stigmatized and the crooked Way praised. How are we to
judge? We must ask for Allah's guidance. With a little spiritual
insight we shall see which are the people who walk in the light of
Allah's grace, and which are those that walk in the darkness of Wrath.
This also would help our judgment.

23. Note that the words relating to Grace are connected actively with
Allah: those relating to Wrath are impersonal. In the one case Allah's
Mercy encompasses us beyond our deserts In the other case our own
actions are responsible for the Wrath,-the negative of Grace, Peace,
or Harmony.

24. Are there two categories?-Those who are in the darkness of Wrath
and those who stray? The first are those who deliberately break
Allah's law; the second those who stray out of carelessness or
negligence. Both are responsible for their own acts or omissions. In
opposition to both are the people who are in the light of Allah's
Grace: for His Grace not only protects them from active wrong (if they
will only submit their will to Him) but also from straying into paths
of temptation or carelessness. The negative 'gair' should be construed
as applying not to the way, but as describing men protected from two
dangers by Allah's Grace.

--------------------
The First Surah Al-Fatihah (The Opening)
Mecca Period THIS SURAH is also called Fatihat al-Kitab ("The Opening
of the Divine Writ"), Umm alKitab ("The Essence of the Divine Writ"),
Surat al-Hamd ("The Surah of Praise"), Asas alQur'an ("The Foundation
of the Qur'an"), and is known by several other names as well. It is
mentioned elsewhere in the Qur'an as As-Sab' al-Mathani ("The Seven
Oft-Repeated [Verses]") because it is repeated several times in the
course of each of the five daily prayers. According to Bukhari, the
designation Umm al-Kitab was given to it by the Prophet himself, and
this in view of the fact that it contains, in a condensed form, all
the fundamental principles laid down in the Qur'an: the principle of
God's oneness and uniqueness, of His being the originator and fosterer
of the universe, the fount of all life-giving grace, the One to whom
man is ultimately responsible, the only power that can really guide
and help; the call to righteous action in the life of this world
("guide us the straight way"); the principle of life after death and
of the organic consequences of man's actions and behaviour (expressed
in the term "Day of Judgment"); the principle of guidance through
God's message-bearers (evident in the reference to "those upon whom
God has bestowed His blessings") and, flowing from it, the principle
of the continuity of all true religions (implied in the allusion to
people who have lived - and erred - in the past); and, finally, the
need for voluntary self-surrender to the will of the Supreme Being
and, thus, for worshipping Him alone. It is for this reason that this
surah has been formulated as a prayer, to be constantly repeated and
reflected upon by the believer. "The Opening" was one of the earliest
revelations bestowed upon the Prophet. Some authorities (for instance,
'Ali ibn Abi Talib) were even of the opinion that it was the very
first revelation; but this view is contradicted by authentic
Traditions quoted by both Bukhari and Muslim, which unmistakably show
that the first five verses of surah 96 ("The Germ-Cell") constituted
the beginning of revelation. It is probable, however, that whereas the
earlier revelations consisted of only a few verses each, "The Opening"
was the first surah revealed to the Prophet in its entirety at one
time: and this would explain the view held by 'Ali.

1:1 In the name of God, The Most Gracious, The Dispenser of Grace:1
1:2 ALL PRAISE is due to God alone, the Sustainer of all the worlds,2
(1:3) the Most Gracious, the Dispenser of Grace,
(1:4) Lord of the Day of Judgment!
1:5 Thee alone do we worship; and unto Thee alone do we turn for aid.
1:6 Guide us the straight way
(1:7) the way of those upon whom Thou hast bestowed Thy blessings,3
not of those who have been condemned [by Thee], nor of those who go
astray!4

1 According to most of the authorities, this invocation (which occurs
at the beginning of every surah with the exception of surah 9)
constitutes an integral part of "The Opening" and is, therefore,
numbered as verse 1. In all other instances, the invocation "in the
name of God" precedes the surah as such, and is not counted among its
verses. - Both the divine epithets rahman and rahim are derived from
the noun rahmah, which signifies "mercy", "compassion", "loving
tenderness" and, more comprehensively, "grace". From the very earliest
times, Islamic scholars have endeavoured to define the exact shades of
meaning which differentiate the two terms. The best and simplest of
these explanations is undoubtedly the one advanced by Ibn al-Qayyim
(as quoted in Manar I,48): the term rahman circumscribes the quality
of abounding grace inherent in, and inseparable from, the concept of
God's Being, whereas rahim expresses the manifestation of that grace
in, and its effect upon, His creation - in other words, an aspect of
His activity.

2 In this instance, the term "worlds" denotes all categories of
existence both in the physical and the spiritual sense. The Arabic
expression rabb - rendered by me as "Sustainer" embraces a wide
complex of meanings not easily expressed by a single term in another
language. It comprises the ideas of having a just claim to the
possession of anything and, consequently, authority over it, as well
as of rearing, sustaining and fostering anything from its inception to
its final completion. Thus, the head of a family is called rabb ad-dar
("master of the house") because he has authority over it and is
responsible for its maintenance; similarly, his wife is called rabbat
ad-dar ("mistress of the house"). Preceded by the definite article al,
the designation rabb is applied, in the Qur'an, exclusively to God as
the sole fosterer and sustainer of all creation - objective as well as
conceptual - and therefore the ultimate source of all authority.

3 i.e., by vouchsafing to them prophetic guidance and enabling them to
avail themselves thereof.

4 According to almost all the commentators, God's "condemnation"
(ghadab, lit., "wrath") is synonymous with the evil consequences which
man brings upon himself by wilfully rejecting God's guidance and
acting contrary to His injunctions. Some commentators (e.g.,
Zamakhshari) interpret this passage as follows: "... the way of those
upon whom Thou hast bestowed Thy blessings - those who have not been
condemned [by Thee], and who do not go astray": in other words, they
regard the last two expressions as defining "those upon whom Thou hast
bestowed Thy blessings". Other commentators (e.g., Baghawi and Ibn
Kathir) do not subscribe to this interpretation - which would imply
the use of negative definitions - and understand the last verse of the
surah in the manner rendered by me above. As regards the two
categories of people following a wrong course, some of the greatest
Islamic thinkers (e.g., Al-Ghazali or, in recent times, Muhammad
'Abduh) held the view that the people described as having incurred
"God's condemnation" - that is, having deprived themselves of His
grace - are those who have become fully cognizant of God's message
and, having understood it, have rejected it; while by "those who go
astray" are meant people whom the truth has either not reached at all,
or to whom it has come in so garbled and corrupted a form as to make
it difficult for them to recognize it as the truth (see 'Abduh in
Manar 1,68 ff.).

Title: Has some Unorthodox Views
Date: Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2020
Review: SHORT VERSION: EXCELLENT TRANSLATION, HIGHLY RECCOMEND, ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE WHO ENJOY TO THINK. JUST BE SLIGHLTY CAUSTIOUS OF A BIT OF THE UNORTHODOX VIEWS.

I must say, I was and continue to be impressed by this work. It will be clear to anyone who reads it that Muhammad Asad invested a lot careful thought and time reading in order to convey an accurate translation and interpretation of the words of the Qur'an.
His in-depth knowledge of classical Arabic, a type of knowledge that is unfortunately dwindling in the modern world, gave him a great intellectual freedom in analyzing various Qur'anic verses. This ability allows him to convey the message of complex verses in the Qur'an to any English speaking person (hence, "Message of the Qur'an"). That is not to say, of course, that he goes to just follow his own whims all the time. He gives great respect and reference to many classical Quran'ic commentators such as Al-Razi, Zamakshari, Baghawi, Ibn Kathir, etc and owes the interpretation of many verses to them. HOWEVER, it should be made aware to the reader that he will occasionally slip in his own understanding of a verse that goes against traditional Islamic theology. For example, he holds some parts of the story of Adam & Eve to be allegorical (therefore not literal) and believes that humans, like other species, were a product of God-guided gradual biological evolutionary processes (essentially Darwin's theory except involving God as described in the Qur'an). In another example, he in the footnote of a verse that is commonly used a basis for the Qur'anic doctrine of abrogation (that is, verses that were revealed by God and then removed later) explains that it is actually not referring to how the Qur'an is abrogating verses within itself but replacing messages from earlier times (like those in the books of the Bible) with one that is better.
Now, this is not to say that all these deviant views are wrong (some of them, of which I've not listed here, I'm actually inclined to believe, such as his view on the Crucifixion of Jesus), and in the end of the day these views are a small % of his actual footnotes. I just want to let any potential reader know that a footnote here or there may not be in line with the common belief of Muslims today.
